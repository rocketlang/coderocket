## Overview
RocketLang‚Äôs CodeEngine, a low/no-code platform powered by JavaScript/Node.js, competes in India‚Äôs $4B market against Bubble, Zoho Creator, Clappia, Kissflow, Replit, and Glitch. This comparison evaluates suitability for laymen (e.g., sailors, shopkeepers, students) in a mobile-heavy (~95% Android) and low-internet (~40%) market. The table below combines a tickmark comparison (‚úÖ/‚ùå) for quick reference with a weighted comparison for detailed analysis.

## Comparison Table
Criteria are weighted by importance to laymen in India (total 100%):  
- **Ease of Use (30%)**: Intuitiveness for non-technical users.  
- **Offline Support (20%)**: Functionality in low-internet areas.  
- **Pricing (20%)**: Affordability for India‚Äôs market.  
- **Complex Tasks (15%)**: High-end apps (e.g., 3D, APIs).  
- **Scalability (10%)**: Growth (50 users in 2025 to 15,000 by 2029).  
- **Integrations (5%)**: API/tool connectivity.  

Tickmarks (‚úÖ = Supported, ‚ùå = Not Supported) indicate feature presence. Scores (0-10) are multiplied by weight (e.g., 9/30% = 2.7) and summed for a total score out of 100.
