# LLM Migration Strategy for CodeRocket

**Date**: May 6, 2025  
**Purpose**: Outline the migration process from DistilBERT to another LLM (e.g., Mistral 7B) while preserving artifacts and learning.

## Migration Steps
1. **Preserve Artifacts**:  
   - Training data in `user_apps` table and JSONL files (e.g., `training_data.jsonl`).  
   - Syntax patterns in `syntax_patterns` table.  
   - Backup DistilBERT checkpoint (`distilbert-rocketlang-2025.pt`) in `C:\CodeRocket\models`.  
2. **Transfer Learned Knowledge**:  
   - Extract mappings from DistilBERT (e.g., "schedule a meeting next week" → `schedule event`).  
   - Retrain new LLM (e.g., Mistral 7B) on same data (~20 hr for 1,000 samples, Q4 2025).  
   - Use distillation to transfer knowledge (DistilBERT as teacher model).  
3. **Update Parsing Pipeline**:  
   - Adapt `voyage_tracker.js` for new LLM outputs (e.g., Mistral 7B tokenization).  
   - Maintain hybrid parsing with rule-based fallback.  
4. **Preserve Artifacts**:  
   - Log migration steps using `manage artifact` (e.g., `LLM_Migration_Log.md`).  
   - Save new LLM checkpoints (e.g., `mistral-rocketlang-2026.pt`).  
5. **Minimize Learning Loss**:  
   - Retrain with same data, deploy incrementally (Q4 2025 for testing, 2026 for full transition).  
   - Preserve self-learned patterns in `syntax_patterns` table.

## Timeline
- **Q4 2025**: Prototype Mistral 7B alongside DistilBERT (~20 hr).  
- **2026**: Full transition to Mistral 7B (~100 hr).  

## Status
Planned on May 5, 2025, to be implemented on Day 4 (May 6, 2025).
